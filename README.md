# LLM-Powered Research Assistant for Creative Industries

This is a custom GPT-4-powered assistant that helps professionals in media, arts, broadcast, and culture explore how Artificial Intelligence can inspire real-world innovation.

**Built by Joseph McCartney â€“ Created as part of my application for an AI apprenticeship**

## What It Does

Users enter a topic (e.g. "AI in museums", "independent cinema", "immersive digital theatre") and the assistant:

1. Summarizes relevant trends and AI innovations in that space  
2. Suggests one or two creative project ideas tailored for organisations like museums, studios, or festivals  
3. Outputs an easy-to-read insight and idea summary

This tool blends creative thinking, AI prompt engineering, and practical application for the industries Peak Signal works with.

## How to Run It Locally

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-creative-research-assistant.git
cd llm-creative-research-assistant
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Youâ€™ll need an OpenAI API key. Add this line at the top of `app.py`:
```python
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"
```

## Why I Built This

This project is designed to address a real-world challenge:  
**How can creative organisations explore and apply AI in ways that are meaningful and useful?**

It demonstrates:
- My ability to apply AI tools to solve real problems  
- Understanding of GPT-based systems  
- Clear thinking and initiative  
- A focus on real-world use cases in creative sectors
